Manual Report: Development Process of Ported Tools

This report manually summarizes the development process, as the LLM call was mocked for this demonstration.

--- Overview ---
A suite of tools was ported from TypeScript to Python to enable a full research workflow. This involved analyzing the original code, selecting Python libraries, and implementing each tool with corresponding tests.

--- Ported Tools ---
The following tools were created: search, fetch_content, parse_document, analyze_results, consolidate_report, optimize_research, generate_final_report, and download.

--- Testing Strategy ---
Each ported tool was accompanied by a unit test file. The tests used Python's `unittest` framework and the `unittest.mock` library to isolate dependencies and verify functionality without making live network calls.
