L3 Orientation Complete. Filesystem: PASS (Write, read, and delete operations successful. - 0.30 ms) | Network: PASS (Successfully connected to https://www.google.com (Status: 200) - 101.90 ms) | Env Vars: PASS (Environment variable 'PATH' is present.)
Temporal orientation complete. Findings saved to knowledge_core/temporal_orientation.md
Plan has been set:
python3 tooling/research.py --target external_web --scope narrow --query "React Hooks best practices 2025"
# The above command will perform the research and save the results.
# A real agent would then parse these results and use them to inform
# the next steps of the plan. For this demonstration, we will simply
# print a message indicating the next logical step.
echo "Next step: Analyze the research findings and refactor the search component."
