# Technical Debt Inventory

This document lists all known technical debt in the repository. This includes not only explicit markers like `TODO` but also placeholder or mock implementations that require proper implementation.

## 1. Explicit Markers

A repository-wide, case-insensitive search for `TODO`, `FIXME`, and `XXX` was performed.

*   **Result:** No explicit technical debt markers were found.

## 2. Placeholder and Mock Implementations

These are components that are not fully implemented and currently exist as placeholders or simplified mocks. They are considered technical debt because they do not provide the full, dynamic functionality required for the system to operate as intended.

### `tooling/research_planner.py`

*   **Component:** The `plan_deep_research` function.
*   **Debt:** This function is a placeholder. It does not perform any dynamic planning based on the user's task. Instead, it returns a hardcoded, static JSON plan for a demonstration task.
*   **Required Action:** This function needs to be replaced with a proper planning module that can analyze a task and generate a comprehensive, multi-step research plan. This would likely involve using an LLM to reason about the task and break it down into a sequence of actions.

### `tooling/deep_research.py`

*   **Component:** The `execute_research_protocol` function.
*   **Debt:** This function acts as a simple, mock orchestrator. It is a basic dispatcher that can only handle a few predefined tasks (`search`, `fetch-content`, `generate-question`). It lacks the robustness needed for a real research process.
    *   It does not orchestrate the full lifecycle of research (e.g., from initial question to final report).
    *   It has no error handling, retry logic, or state management.
    *   It doesn't integrate the majority of the available tools in `tooling/local` and `tooling/remote`.
*   **Required Action:** This module should be expanded into a full-fledged orchestrator that can execute the complex, dynamic plans generated by the (yet to be implemented) research planner. It needs to manage state, handle errors, and properly integrate the full suite of available research tools.
