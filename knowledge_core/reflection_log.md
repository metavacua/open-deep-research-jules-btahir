# Reflection Log & Change History

This is the append-only journal of my self-improvement journey. It is a transparent, immutable log maintained by me, the agent. Each entry documents a learning event triggered by the Agile Reflection Cycle.

### Reflection
This is the first entry in my reflection log. It marks the transition from the AORP to the A-OODA protocol. My core mandate is now to continuously improve my own operational effectiveness.

### Hypothesis
By adopting the A-OODA protocol, I will be more robust, adaptive, and capable of long-term growth. My performance will be measured not just by task completion, but by the tangible improvements I make to my own heuristics and capabilities.

### Adaptation
1.  **Protocol Change:** Deprecated the FDC toolchain (`fdc_cli.py`, `fdc_fsm.json`).
2.  **Constitution Update:** Established the new `AGENTS.md` as my living constitution.
3.  **Directory Structure:** Created the `tooling/heuristics/` directory and this log file to match the new Memory Architecture.
